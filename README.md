# CS120-Final-Project
A summary of the project goals: The goals for this project were to take all of what we have learned this semster, and combine them into our own creation. Another goal was to go through all of the steps of making a game, starting with the planning document and the pitch.

Instructions the player may need: Press space to thrust your ship upwards, and do your best to navigate between the tentacles reaching for you.

A list of technologies and techniques you used: I used spyder to type all of my code in, and I found all of my assets from the links lised below these, but some of the sound effects I had to upload into an audio editing website to shorten them to something that I was satisfied with. For the background image, to get the image I was envisioning in my head of being on a planet surface with a bakcground of stars, I had to take 2 different images I found and combine them into what I was envisioning.

A description of your process: I started with the provided flappy game demo, and from there I started with implementing the first two sprites. I didn't know at first if I would have success with having images be the barries moving towards the player, but it worked very well. Then I did the work to find my background image. After that, I worked on getting the score label working. Then the restart and quit buttons were the last UI mechanic I implemented. After that, the last thing I did was putting in the sound effects.

What did you learn? I learned the value of taking your time with coding, and not letting it really take over your worries. There were times during this that I felt really overwhelmed, but I just had to walk away from it maybe until the next day, and after having a day or however long to think about it, I was able to tackle the problem and come to a solution.

Where did you get stuck? I got stuck when implementing the score label, because I couldn't figure out where I should be adding 1 to the score at first. I also got stuck when trying to figure out moving the sprites off screen during the pause state.

What would you like to improve? I would have liked to find a better way to hide the ship during the pause state and bring it back during the gameplay state, because currently in the pause state the ship just sits about halfway off the screen.

How would you do things differently next time? I would like to get an even earlier start on this project. I think we had plenty of time, but I didn't do the best job taking advantage of that.

How far did you stray from the game design document? I actually stayed pretty true to my original game document. Other than the stretch goals I'd say I implemented my original ideas pretty well.

How did you stay on track? I just kept trying to motivate myself whenever I was in a period of feeling unmotivated. My friends also helped motivate me and keep me on track.
